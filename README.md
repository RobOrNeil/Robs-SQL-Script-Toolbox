# Robs-SQL-Script-Toolboxs
SQL Server scripts and tools used to assist in querying, maintaining, and building your data.  This is an organizational and cleanup process for me personally that I felt I could share with others who might need do the same tasks as I've had to track down.  Currently still a work in progress and I'll be adding more.

## Dependency Checks
Scripts meant to find dependencies such as tables, procedures, functions, or views relying on certain code or keys.
